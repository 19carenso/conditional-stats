This package has several objectives:

- facilitate the calculation of the statistical distribution of a variable X for various binning choices
  1) Linear bins in X
  2) Logarithmic in X
  3) Linear percentile ranks (10th,20th,30th,40th,...), ie standard CDF calculation
  4) Inverse-logarithmic percentile ranks (90th, 99th, 99.9th, 99.99th, ...), ie calculation of extremes
  
- calculate error bounds on the distribution with random resampling

- compute conditional statistics (composites and variability) of variable Y within bins of X

- implement all of the above for either a fixed dataset or over a moving time window

This was developed for the investigation of precipitation extremes and other physical mechanisms in atmospheric sciences.
